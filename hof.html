								Born in Newark, New Jersey, on March 6, 1972,
								Shaquille O'Neal went on to become one of the most dominant players in NBA history,
								helping his teams to win NBA Championships and Olympic gold.
								Following his 2011 retirement, Shaq became an NBA analyst,
								working alongside the likes of Charles Barkley and Ernie Johnson.
								In his rookie season with the Orlando Magic, Shaquille O'Neal, also known as "Shaq,"
								finished in the Top 10 in scoring, rebounding, blocks and shooting percentage.
								A notoriously bad free-throw shooter, Shaq focused on trying to get more of his points on the power slam,
								and hearty NBA centers quickly learned to try to foul Shaq rather than give him an easy shot.
								Shaq became the first player in NBA history to be named "Player of the Week" in his first week in the league.
